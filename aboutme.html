    My name is Pierce Terry, I am 20 years old, I am from St. Louis, Missouri, however, I was originially born in North Carolina, as well as living in Virginia for several years. I am a sophomore at Mizzou and I chose to major in Information Technology because I have always been interested in technology as a whole. I had previously been majoring in history, however, I came to the realization that a career in the tech field would be better suited to my skill set and interests. While I am still a novice and only beginning to understand the fundamentals of IT, I am confident that I will be able to succeed and find myself working in the technological industry in the future.</p>
