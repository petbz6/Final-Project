     <p style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
    My name is Pierce Terry, I am 20 years old, I am from St. Louis, Missouri, however, I was originially<br>
    born in North Carolina, as well as living in Virginia for several years.<br>
    I am a sophomore at Mizzou and I chose to major in Information Technology<br> 
    because I have always been interested in technology as a whole. <br> 
    I had previously been majoring in history, however, I came to the<br> 
    realization that a career in the tech field would be better suited to my skill set and interests.<br>
    While I am still a novice and only beginning to understand the fundamentals of IT, I am confident<br>     
    that I will be able to succeed and find myself working in the technological industry in the future.</p>
