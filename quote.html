<h2>Below is one of my favorite quotes from the book:</h2>
<p>Sam: It’s all wrong<br>
    By rights we shouldn’t even be here.<br>
    But we are.<br>
    It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo.<br>
    The ones that really mattered.<br>
    Full of darkness and danger they were,<br>
    and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end.<br>
    Because how could the end be happy.<br>
    How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened.<br>
    But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow.<br>
    Even darkness must pass.<br>
    A new day will come.<br>
    And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.<br>
    Those were the stories that stayed with you.<br>
    That meant something.<br>
    Even if you were too small to understand why.<br>
    But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.<br>
    I know now.<br>
    Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t.<br>
    Because they were holding on to something.<br>
    Frodo: What are we holding on to, Sam?<br>
    Sam : That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.<br><i>- Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i></p>
